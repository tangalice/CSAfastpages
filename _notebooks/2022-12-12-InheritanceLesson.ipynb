    "### Vocab\n",
    "- inheritance, extends\n",
    "    - a way for attributes and methods to be inherited between clases\n",
    "    - extends is what allows you to bring those attributes\n",
    "- subclass constuctor, super Keyword 2\n",
    "    - A subclass inherits all the members from the superclass while the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass\n",
    "    - Super keyword refers to superclass objects; it is used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass costructor\n",
    "- Overloading a method, same name different parameters\n",
    "    - Overloading a method in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters\n",
    "    - Instead of defining two methods that do the same thing, it is better to overload one\n",
    "- Polymorphism: any of overloading, overriding, late binding\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method depending on the type of object that is passed to the method\n",
    "    - Allows us to perform the same action in many different ways"

    "### Inheritance\n",
    "- the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class\n",
    "- without inheritance, you have to rewrite methods in each different class\n",
    "- with inheritance, create a superclass vehicle which is extended by subclasses (don't have to rewrite methods)\n",

    "- public class A {...}\n",
    "- public class B extends A {...}\n",

    "### Overriding\n",

    "### Inheritance Hierachies\n",
    "- superclasses and subclasses are gernally organized into a single root tree strucutre called an inheritance hierachy \n",
    "- lower levels of hierchy inherit attributes and methods from upper level\n",
    "- object type and refernce type can be different when instantiating an object variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- utilized when a method is implemented to perform different tasks in different classes\n",
    "- allows method to take on multiple \"forms\" or implementations based on specific object it is acting upon "
